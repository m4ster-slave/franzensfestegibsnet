# A travellers guide to the train station

The passageway, or: why nothing seems quite right and everything is exactly the way it's supposed to be.

It's an eerie observation to make, how everything falls silent. Have you never noticed?
There's no birds, no locals babbling about, just the whistle of the ever-cold wind and the wheezing of traintracks.
There's nothing.
And if you decide to leave the station, there's even less. Here, there isn't even the occasional stranded traveller to keep you silent company, just empty streets. The bars are never open. No store has its lights on. And if you wander further, you'll see houses that visually appear inhabited, yet seem utterly abandoned. It's eerie. Especially because you can tell there's nobody here. Just you.
Don't wander off too far though - lest you miss the train.
And never, ever, forget the way back to the station. It's the only way out.
Keep that in mind.
Best to never leave its safety in the first place. The station is just the passageway, the beginning. Neither quite here nor there.

You can leave only the way you enter: Catch a train. A bit difficult, sometimes since they often seem to suddenly break down or never appear in the first place. But they will drive.
You can't walk the tracks, I think (though I will admit, I haven't tried) and there's nothing else. Not that I or anyone knows of.
